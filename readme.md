### Guide to using get_top_burger.py:
# To run this program you will need a machine (preferably Linux) running a Python3 interpreter.
# Open the terminal and navigate to the directory containing the get_top_burger.py file using the 'cd' command.
# To ensure to program runs as intended it is best to have the text file containing orders to be in the same directory as get_top_burger.
# You will want to rename the text file to order.txt if it has not been done so already.
# For the program to run correctly the order.txt file will need to contain the ingredients in the following format with one single order per line of text:

#    milk,tomato,2,1,yes,no,no

# To run the program: type 'python3 get_top_burger.py' into the terminal and press enter.
# You will then be prompted to enter the number of most common burger orders in the order list.
# If the previous steps are followed, the program will return the inputted number of top burger orders along with the number of times they were ordered and the cost of that burger.
# If you encounter an error of any kind the code should be able to prompt you to whatever may be the cause of the issue, whether that be an incorrect input or poor formatting in orders.txt.
